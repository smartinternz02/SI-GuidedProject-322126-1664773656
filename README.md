## Deep Learning Techniques for Breast Cancer Risk Prediction using IBM Cloud


Breast cancer is one of the main causes of cancer death worldwide. Computer-aided diagnosis systems showed the potential for improving diagnostic accuracy. But early detection and prevention can significantly reduce the chances of death. It is important to detect breast cancer as early as possible.

The goal is to classify images into two classifications of malignant and benign. As early diagnostics significantly increases the chances of correct treatment and survival. In this application, we are helping the doctors and patients to classify the Type of Tumour for the specific image given with the help of Neural Networks.
